# Informed-decision-making-on-healthcare-facility-locations-in-expanding-refugee-settlements
This project is performed to obtain a MSc. degree in Engineering and Policy Analysis at Delft University of Technology.

The folder contains:
- 1x PDF with the master thesis: "Informed decision-making on healthcare facility locations in expanding refugee camps - MMT Nering BÃ¶gel"
- 3x NetLogo models:
   1. "Camp expansion model - PyNetlogo model" (used in combination with the PyNetLogo extension)
   2. "Camp expansion model - separate use" (for usage without Python)
   3. "Camp expansion model SA -  PyNetlogo model" (used for the sensitivity analysis)
- 2x "RoadsLikeDashboard" files, used to create the model environment in NetLogo.
- 2x Excel files that contain the experiment definitions:
   1. "experiments_globals_longlist" (defines the different parameter settings throughout the experiments)
   2. "experiments_globals_SA_list" (used for the sensitivity analysis)
- 1x Python notebook script: "PynetlogoModel-AllModels-Final.ipynb" (contains the two used algorithms and defines the four different models)
